		<p>AI is the most popular topic in tech in 2023, influencing a wide range of areas from literature to cars and even law. 
		   Many concerns have arisen due to the nature of this technology potentially taking jobs from people who need them and detracting from the jobs that still exist. 
		   This site will focus on AI generated art specifically, covering it's potential to steal from creators, detract from creativity and potentially destroy itself in the long run.</p>
