			<h2>IL Task 1: Choosing Your Topic</h2>
			<p>I first considered all of the memorable parts of DMIS that I have done so far. 
				Then I removed the ones I thought would be too broad for this task or that wouldn't be 
				as engaging to a wider audience. Next I brainstormed more specific ideas for the remaining 
				broad areas.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Data Analysis</li>
					<ul>
						<li>"The importance of Data Analysis in Game Design"</li>
					</ul>
				<li><s>Document Encoding</s></li>
				<li>AI</li>
					<ul>
						<li>"AI and the Decline of Creativity"</li>
						<li>"AI and it's Danger to Humanity"</li>
					</ul>
				<li><s>ECCO</s></li>
				<li>3D Modelling</li>
					<ul>
						<li>"How to Preserve the Past with 3D Modelling and Why it's Important"</li>
					</ul>
				<li><s>Digitisation</s></li>
				<li>Ethics</li>
					<ul>
						<li>"How Digital Media changed our View on Ethics"</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Digital Media in Cultural Heritage</li>
				<li><s>Databases</s></li>
			</ul>
			<p>It became clear to me while working on this list that AI would be the most engaging and
				fun topic to talk about. Between the two topics in this area I decided to go with 
				"AI and the Decline of Creativty" as this was a little more grounded and relevant to today. 
			 	I quickly decided to reword it to "Is AI Art Destroying Creativity? And should we be Worried?" 
				to frame it more as two seperate questions which should allow for more intrigue and 
				back-and-fourth.</p>

			<h2>IL Task 2: Explore the Topic Scope and Narrow the Focus</h2>
			<p>Some questions I want to answer in my website include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What is the supposed "death spiral" of AI training off of other AI data that I've heard about?</li>
					<li>How is AI art affecting professional creative people's livelihood?</li>
					<li>What is the general (non-artist) population's opinion on AI art?</li>
					<li>How do artists on average feel about AI art?</li>
					<li>Could AI art destroy traditional creativity?</li>
				</ul>
			<p>I think the following groups would or could be interested in my website:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Artists</li>
					<li>Other Creative People</li>
					<li>People who Train AI</li>
					<li>Investors in AI</li>
					<li>People who Create AI Art</li>
					<li>Average people who are interested in AI and Art</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Lab Task 1: File Structure</h2>
			<p>For my portfolio I decided to use the provided template, giving me a base so I could edit things to my liking piece by piece. I figure this will save time in the long run and make it easy to keep track of changes. The provided template is an example of a hybrid website structure, keeping all site pages in one directory but having resources like images and audio in their own sub directory. This feels best for a site that will expand with time.</p>

			<h2>Lab Task 2: HTML Review</h2>
			<p>Having done a number of courses during my time in DMIS that used HTML I feel confident in my ability and am familiar with a number of resources to help me if I get stuck. As such I have decided to skip this task, as is offered.
