		<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1</h2>
		<p>For my portfolio I decided to use the provided template, giving me a base so I could edit things to my liking piece by piece. I figure this will save time in the long run and make it easy to keep track of changes. The provided template is an example of a hybrid website structure, keeping all site pages in one directory but having resources like images and audio in their own sub directory. This feels best for a site that will expand with time.</p>

		<section id="task2">
		<h2>Task 2</h2>
		<p>Having done a number of courses during my time in DMIS that used HTML I feel confident in my ability and am familiar with a number of resources to help me if I get stuck. As such I have decided to skip this task, as is offered.
