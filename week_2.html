			<h3>Task 1: Identifying your Audience(s)</h3>
			<p>I think because AI is a rapidly evolving and fairly new field of study, my topic lends itself well to a large audience of people who aren't very knowledgeable about the subject. For the purpose of this task I will focus on young-adult to millenial people who are not already acquainted with AI.<p>
			<P>This is a useful age range as these people are likely to be somewhat computer/website savy so should be able to navigate my website, and may have some pre-concieved notions about AI but are unlikely to be very knowledgable on it otherwise.</p>
			<p>It's also useful as since I'm a student, I have a lot of people around me that fit the younger end of this demographic to help with user testing. For the older end I may have to ask for assistance online or consult with family members.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Age: 15 - 40</li>
				<li>Gender: all</li>
				<li>Language Proficiency: Average English Ability</li>
				<li>Education Level: High-school</li>
				<li>Attitude: Skeptical, Intriduged</li>
				<li>Knowledge: Very little - None</li>
				<li>Auidence Action: Leave feeling more informed</li>

		<h3>Task 1: Identifying and Evaluating Websites</h3>
		
		<h4>Websites Used:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">Whitehouse Website</a></li>
		</ol>
		
		<h4>The Audience</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>As it's the website for a school, the audience should be for young people and a few older staff members. The design seems to fit this as the disperate styles, colours and images across all the pages would appeal (at least ironically) to young students. I do however feel like as a staff member this would be a nightmare to navigate. It has all the information a student would need. The site has interaction in the form of being able to login, pause and play interactions and most of all, seemingly edit the page in it's entirety if you are a student or staff member.</li>
			<li>The website seems targetted at a very wide range of people, as it is an official government website. I do think it would be mildly uninteresting for younger people though as the use of colour is limited and it's very wordy. This is alliviated somewhat by the smooth scrolling and mouse-over animations as well as the use of images further down the page. The interaction is fairly limited as this serves as more of a hub for other government pages.  </li>
