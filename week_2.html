			<h2>IL Task 1: Defining your Audience</h2>
			<p>I think because AI is a rapidly evolving and fairly new field of study, my topic lends itself 
				well to a large audience of people who aren't very knowledgeable about the subject. For the 
				purpose of this task I will focus on young-adult to millenial people who are not already 
				acquainted with AI.
				<br><br>
				This is a useful age range as these people are likely to be somewhat computer/website savy
				so should be able to navigate my website, and may have some pre-concieved notions about AI 
				but are unlikely to be very knowledgable on it otherwise.
				<br><br>
				It's also useful as since I'm a student, I have a lot of people around me that fit the younger
				end of this demographic to help with user testing. For the older end I may have to ask for 
				assistance online or consult with family members.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Age: 15 - 40</li>
				<li>Gender: all</li>
				<li>Language Proficiency: Average English Ability</li>
				<li>Education Level: High-school</li>
				<li>Attitude: Skeptical, Intriduged</li>
				<li>Knowledge: Very little - None</li>
				<li>Auidence Action: Leave feeling more informed</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>IL Task 2: Auidence Personas</h2>
			<p>Below is a persona for a theoretical audience member who my website will be targeted at:</p>

									   <br>Casual gamer
									   <br>Frequents news sites</td></tr>

										<br>To have a stable income through their work
										<br>To not have their work stolen for AI training</td></tr>

			<h2>Task 1: Identifying and Evaluating Websites</h2>
			
			<h3>Websites Used:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yale School of Art</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitehouse Website</a></li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>The Audience</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>As it's the website for a school, the audience should be for young people and a few older
						    staff members.</li>
						<li>It has all the information a student would need. </li>
						<li>The site has interaction in the form of being able to login, pause and play
						    interactions and most of all, seemingly edit the page in it's entirety if you are a student
						    or staff member.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>The website seems targetted at a very wide range of people, as it is an official government website. </li>
						<li>The site is ordered in a convenient way, showing you the broadstrokes first and the things the government
							cares about most at the top. From there you can find more specific info and as such is appropriate for the topic.</li>
						<li>The interaction is fairly limited as this serves as more of a hub for other government pages, however 
							it does have a specific section to let people text or message the White House in addition to being able 
							to join the Biden-Harris Administration or apply for internships or jobs. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Affordances, Conceptual Models and Signifiers</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>The purpose of the project is to serve as a hub for community members of the Yale School of Art.</li>
						<li>The site is surprisingly easy to use as because everything stands out so much, finding what you're looking for seems fairly easy.</li>
						<li>The persistant side navigation bar helps a lot in allowing you to return home or go to another page no matter where you are. The huge,
							sometimes animated images in the background help to tell where you are but the way titles and subtitles are styled with color and fonts 
							make them hard to read almost all the time. </li>
						<li>Yale School of Art's website makes extensive use of images and gifs, particularly in it's backgrounds. Most of the time these are tiled.
							Thankfully there is a button to pause the animated gifs if someone were to find them distracting or had light sensitivities.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>The purpose of the project is to server as a hub for all information and other sites relating to
							the current USA government and the White House itself.</li>
						<li>The White House website is also quite easy to navigate, as the thoughtful design uses images
							where important, has a clear navigation bar and larger menu at the top, and divides the website 
							in a way that makes it easy to use. </li>
						<li>Surprisingly, the "clean look" the White House website is going for sometimes makes it harder to
							tell where you are and how to navigate. Some pages don't have a navigation bar, opting for a small
							drop-down menu instead, and some pages have a heading that's hard to parse at first glance.</li>
						<li>The use of media on this site is varied and very interactive, although due to the size of the site 
							could feel a little sparse. It features images, interactive maps and lots of embeded instagram posts and videos. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>Layout, graphics and colour is where this website either fails completely or makes for an interesting point/experiment. 
							As these elements of the site are freely changeable they generally appear messy and unprofessional and sometimes even completely
							random. Other times however they happen to line-up with the purpose of the page but generally I think the use of background
							colour and gradients for blocks of text make for an unappealing website.</li>
						<li>The spacing between elements is usually consistant but not always. These is generally a large amount of white-space on the right side
							of the page as it doesn't scale up to even a small laptop screen.</li>
						<li>The fairly consistent navigation and usually consistant layout of the information saves the page from being mostly unusable. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>The site uses a very consistent white background with blue navigation bars and blocks for important sections. 
							Text and titles use a dark blue which contrasts the background well and evokes the colour of the Democratic party.
							Images are effectively used to head individual pages and highlight important or recent events without being overwhelming.
							Orange text is used to contrast the usual blue text for hyperlinks, drop lettering and other small details.</li>
						<li>The project scales perfectly to any size of screen keeping perfect balance and symmetry, creating a pleasent and easy
							viewing experience on any device.</li>
						<li>The navigation is somewhat inconsistent, some pages have a top navigation bar where as others rely on a dropdown menu.
							Some links take you to completely different websites where others lead to subpages and this is not always obvious.
							Content is more consistent being generally appealing to consume but not boring, using alternate layouts here and there.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			<h2>Task 2: Consider your Audience</h2>
			<p>In general I would like my website to be a sort of middle ground between the style, interactivity and general feel of the two websites.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>YSoA's website is very attention grabbing and seems like it would appeal to a younger audience, but the text is often hard to read and 
					generally feels unserious and improfessional which I would like to avoid.</li>
				<li>The White House's site radiates the confidence and no-nonsense attitude you would expect from the US Government but still feels somewhat modern, 
					making use of interactive elements and graphics to header pages. Despite this it is very wordy and the backgrounds, fonts and headers used can come off
					as uninspired and potentially boring to a younger audience.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As such, I have identified some aspects I would to keep and others I would like to avoid:</p>
			<table style = "width:95%">
				<tr><th>Use</th><th>Avoid</th></tr>
				<tr><td>
						<ul>
							<li>Consistent navigation bar(s)</li>
							<li>Minimalist backgrounds/sparing use of backgrounds</li>
							<li>Consistent colour scheme</li>
							<li>Interactive elements</li>
							<li>Frequent images/graphical elements</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
					<td>
						<ul>
							<li>Background confined to text/headers</li>
							<li>Tiling images</li>
							<li>Fast moving backgrounds</li>
							<li>Incredibly wordy pages</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
