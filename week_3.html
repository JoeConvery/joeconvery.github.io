		<p>For the narrative structure of my website I think the double question nature of my headline will help a lot. Instead of using a standard "action curve" where the stakes peak at the end of the 2nd act, I'll use more of an "ebb and flow" style. Instead of ramping the stakes at a steady rate over the course of my narrative, my story will include quick ramps followed by a methodical consideration of the stakes, and hopefully a lowering of them. This will continue until near the end where it will either ramp again, ending in a sort of cliffhanger, or gradually come back down to an equilibrium, depending on my findings and conclusion. </p>

		<p>Starting with some of the history of AI art and then moving into spcific cases will hopefully be a good balance of context and more modern examples.</p>
