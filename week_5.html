			<h2>IL Task 1: Reviewing Professional Writing Characteristics</h2>
			<p style="font-style: italic">For this task I reviewed the 14 characteristics of professional writing.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="5il2">
			<h2>IL Task 2: Evaluate Resources</h2>
			<h3>Website(s) Used:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://www.aiacceleratorinstitute.com/is-generative-ai-killing-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Is Generative AI Killing Creativity?"</a></li>
				<li><a href="pdfs/the_artist_in_the_machine_ch1.pdf">The Artist in the Machine: Chapter 1</a></li>

			</ol>

			<h3>Accuracy</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>This article unfortunately doesn't pass the accuracy test in my opinion. It starts with examples of what generative AI is,
					but it a takes up too much of the article and doesn't really accomplish much. From here it doesn't get much better, the writer
					claims they don't feel like AI art will kill creativity but doesn't site any sources for their conclusion. They do have a bibliography
					section but the first link is dead and the others are just the examples they used in the first part of the article.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Active Voice</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>The writer talks in first-person often and uses active voice appropriately.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Bias</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>There is a quite large and obvious bias in this article which I think is why as a whole it is somewhat low-effort and
					not backed-up with sources. Firstly, the article is featured on "AI Accelerator Institute" a website and group that focuses
					on AI and it's many uses and how to improve them. "AI Accelerationism" is also the concept that AI and automation should
					be advanced as quickly as possible because this would be best for humanity. 
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Clarity</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>There is very little jargon used in this article and the few terms that are used are explained with examples or broken-down abbreviations.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>IL Task 3: The AWE Writing Process</h2>
			<p>In terms of the steps of the AWE writing process, I think I'm about 50/50.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Assess</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Define Audience: My audience is a little broad but I think it's defined and works for my project.</li>
					<li>Define Purpose: My website is definitely more about informing and entertaining than anything else.</li>
					<li>Conduct Research: I definitely have a few books and articles in 
						mind but I'd like some other types of data like databases and graphs etc</li>
					<li>Organise, Categorise & Outline: This is where my project is currently behind most in terms of the first step of AWE writing.</li>
				</ol>
				<li>Write</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Create a draft: I think I'm at the stage where I could make a draft with the ideas and information I've gathered so far.</li>
					<li>Read and Revise: ...however it hasn't been long enough for me to look at it uncritically so I'm not at this stage yet.</li>
				</ol>
				<li>Edit</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Check for Correctness and Organisation: As I have not quite completed stage 2, I would be unready to do this.</li>
					<li>Paragraph and Sentence Level Editing: I believe my writing style is quite competent so I don't forsee this stage being a problem.</li>
				</ol>

			<h2>Lab Task 1: Using Voyant-tools to Explore Textual Content</h2>
			<p>For this task I entered the URL of the first article I studied in the IL task which produced these results:</p>
			<img src="images/voyant_1.png" alt="(Image of Voyant Tools results)" height="500">
			<br>
			<ul>
			   <li>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the part that stands out most here to me is the word cloud. More specifically, the lack
			   of any negative words in the 75 most used on the website. The most popular words (outside the of the ones used 
			   in the article's question) are asperational: "future", "vision", "want", "new" etc.</li>
			   <li>The articles limited use of jargon is also very apparent from the word cloud and fits with my prior observations</li>
			   <li>Similarly the lack of sources used is also obvious, as with more citations we would see a lot more years,
				names or page numbers (depending on the style used).</li>

			<h2>Lab Task 2: Update your Moodboard and Website</h2>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">For this task I made sure my website and moodboard were up-to-date with the last few
			weeks worth of work and findings.</p>
