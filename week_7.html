			<h2>IL Task 1: The Stages of the Creative Process</h2>
			<p>There have been a lot of little decisions and design implementations that I have carried out over this semester.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A prominent example of this was with "The Uncensored Library", the website for a Minecraft-based project relating to
					freedom of information.</li>
				<li>This website and project are targeted at a younger audience based all around the world and is very technology
					themed, making it a pretty good comparison to my own project.</li>
				<li>Immediately the dark coloured bars used to seperate sections and use of whitespace stood out to me as being relatively
					simple concepts, but that add a lot of professionalism and modernity to the site.</li>
				<li>Additionally the background images that move with the users scrolling seemed very stylish to me, and are a feature
					I would like to implement something similar to when I can.</li>

			<h2>IL Task 2: Analyse the use of Images on the Web</h2>
			<p>For the first part of this task, I'm looking at the header images of 3 of the articles I've been looking at:</p>
			<img src="images/forbes.png" alt="(Image from Forbes Article)" width="33%"><img src="images/the_conversation.png" alt="(Image from The Conversation Article)" width="33%"><img src="images/ai_accelerator.png" alt="(Image from AI Accelerator Institute Article)" width="33%">
			<table style = "width:96.75%">
				<tr><th>Forbes</th><th>The Conversation</th><th>AI Accelerator Institute</th></tr>
				<tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">
						<ul>
							<li>This is what I would refer
								to as the most typical use 
								of an advertising image.</li>
							<li>The article has a negative 
								outlook of the topic and 
								demonstrates this with a 
								negative image (humans turning
								into robots)</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
					<td style="vertical-align:top;">
						<ul>
							<li>This article from "The Conversation"
								takes a slightly different approach.</li>
							<li>Despite being an outwardly negative 
								article, the image used to market it 
								is more serene and hopeful even.</li>
							<li>I believe this image was used here 
								because it stands out amongst it's
								peers and possibly even suggests that 
								although AI could kill creativity, 
								there is a way to prevent it, and thus
								acts as a call to action.</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
					<td style="vertical-align:top;">
						<ul>
							<li>Again I believe this article has a 
								different methodology behind it's
								advertising image as well.</li>
							<li>As documented earlier in week 5,
								this article has an obvious bias
								towards AI and yet, uses a negative
								image here.</li>
							<li>I believe this might be to bring 
								reader's expectations down before
								lifting them back-up again, in a 
								somewhat sly way to make the reader
								adopt the writer's viewpoint.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<br>
			<p>Some of these articles also feature images for other purposes:</p>
			<img src="images/comprehension.png" alt="(Image used for comprehension from The Conversation)" width="50%">
			<ul>
				<li>This image from the The Converation article was used to give an example for how AI can be used creatively,
					increasing the readers comprehension of the topic</li>
				<li>Additionally, all images used on all three of the articles I analysed here were raster images, usually PNGs, instead of
					vectors.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>IL Task 3: Generate a Portfolio of Images</h2>
			<p>This task involved collating images relevant to my project. I have downloaded a selection of royalty free ones to a local folder
			   and have also created an area for them on my mood board:</p>

			<h2>Lab Task 1: Optimise your Images for Web Use</h2>
			<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">For this task I installed GIMP and learned how to use some of it's functions, including: greyscale, image scaling and cropping. 
															  Using these functions where appropriate is important for optimising images for websites.</p>

			<h2>Lab Task 2: File Naming, File Format Settings and Exporting</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>I will be saving this file as a JPG as it is photograph.</li>
				<li>For the name of the file I decided to go with "woman_study_laptop_grayscale.jpg" as this is a succinct description of whats
					happening in the photo without being too long and uses underscores instead of spaces. Additionally, the unaltered version
					of the file is called "woman_study_laptop.jpg" so it is obvious that these files are related.
				</li>
				<li>After exporting the file and making sure all of the settings were correct, I was left with the final product seen below.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Lab Task 3: Exploring Alternative Options</h2>
			<img src="master-files/woman_study_laptop_pastel.jpg" alt="(pastel color version)">
			<ol>
				<li>For this alternate version I limited the colours to 16-bit and also reduced it to 16ppi: <img src="master-files/woman_study_laptop_16bit.jpg" alt="(16-bit colour version)"></li><br>
				<li>For this alternate version I increased the scale to 2000px and 100ppi while keeping full colour: <img src="master-files/woman_study_laptop_2000px.jpg" alt="(scaled to 2000px and cropped differently version)"><br>
				<li>For this alternate version I limited the colours to pastels only and changed it to a 1000px width: <img src="master-files/woman_study_laptop_pastel.jpg" alt="(pastel color version)">
			</ol>
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>I would give the first alternate a rating of "fine" as although it is undoubtably lower quality, it's not bad enough to be indiscernible, 
			   rather the lower quality gives it a retro style which could fit my topic in some areas.</p>
			<p>The second version however I would give an "inferior" as it is just too big and detailed to be useful on my page.
			   If it were stylized in some way it could work as a background.</p>
			<p>Despite somewhat liking the 3rd alternate personally, I have to give it an "unusable" as it is too unclear and bright for my chosen aesthetic and
			   audience.</p>
