			<h2>IL Task 1: Analyse the Use of Audio on the Web</h2>
			<p>From what I could find, the two websites that fit my theme and/or style that use audio are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://downstream.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downstream</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://dezea.digital/showcase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dezea</a></li>
			</ol>

			<h3>What is the audio used for?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>Downstream's site uses audio for background ambience, button and keyboard input response and other interactables (like the minigame) on-screen.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>Dezea similarly uses audio for button inputs but also includes sound for mousing over buttons. </li>
						<li>It has something more akin to background music than the tech-y ambience of Downstream's website.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Does the audio intentionally enhance information comprehension, retention and appeal?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>The notes that play upon pressing the buttons in the simon says minigame are a staple of the game and help players memorize the pattern.</li>
						<li>The satisfying jingle that plays when you win the game also provides a sense of accomplishment.</li>
						<li>The rumbling background ambience does give the site a sense of immersion and conveys the tech-y/futuristic vision it's aiming for.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>Dezea's use of mouse-over sound effects prompts the user to click on the buttons and explore more of the site, aiding in retention.</li>
						<li>Because of the sites scroll-focused browsing however there are surprisingly few oppertunities for this to come up.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Advantages or disadvantages of the audio used?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>The feedback from the buttons definitely made me want to continue playing the minigame, without this I don't think it would be nearly as appealing.</li>
						<li>The background ambience, while somewhat immersive, was overall too loud and without a way to turn it down or disable it without silencing the other sound effects,
							feels more intrusive than anything.</li>
						</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>In a very similar sense to the first website, the mouse-over sounds on the buttons made me want to explore the website further and find other uses of this effect.</li>
						<li>But also in a similar way, the inability to disable the music, which in this case was very repetitive,
							without disabling the sound effects made the entire implementation of sound feel wasted.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>How is the audio combined with other media?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>The button pressing audio combined with the visual pressing of the buttons.</li>
						<li>Clicking the playtest report would produce a printer sound while visually displaying information.</li>
						<li>Clicking the video on the right of the screen plays a static effect both auditorily and visually before swapping the video.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>Buttons light-up and move when you mouse over them, synced to their sound effects.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Lab Task 1: Optimize your Audio for Web Use</h2>
			<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">In this task I trimmed my audio down and exported it in 4 forms, once as a .WAV and then 3 different variations of .MP3</p>
