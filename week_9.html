			<h2>IL Task 1: Analysing the Use of Video on the Web</h2>
			<p>From what I could find, the two websites that fit my theme and/or style that use audio are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://www.synthesia.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synthesia</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://narita-akihabara.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fa-So-La Akihabara</a></li>
			</ol>

			<h3>What are the videos used for?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>Synthesia predominantly uses videos to show examples of their AI software and how to use it.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>Fa-So-La on the otherhand uses liberal use of animation and videos to transition between information on it's site and to make them seem exciting and modern.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Do the videos intentionally enhance information comprehension, retention and appeal?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>The selection of videos on Synthesia are a prime example of videos adding comprehension and understanding to their product. 
							Videos showcase everything from changing the language of the AI to the different appearances and tones of voice.</li>
						<li>Despite this being incredibly useful it's not particularly exciting but to someone in the market for software like this
							I assume it would be good for retention and appeal.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>The varied colours and vibrant animations are hugely beneficial for the appeal and retition of the site as they make you want
							to explore the entire project to avoid missing any details.</li>
						<li>They are however, by design, very distracting and make it hard to actually focus on any of the information on the page. This
							probably hurts comprehension but it's such an incredibly lively page that I don't think much information needs conveyed outside of 
							the general jist.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Advantages or disadvantages of the videos used?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>Incredibly informative on the product being offered.</li>
						<li>I can't see any obvious disadvantages outside of perhaps the language trials not having one you need, putting a potential client off.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>Such flashy videos clearly show off what the shop is all about.</li>
						<li>The videos are a little long for essentially being a fancy scroll between information. There is a way to skip these at the side but it's not obvious.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>How are the videos combined with other media?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of the videos can have sound toggled on or off, others have sound built-in to show-off the AI voices the company offers.</li>
						<li>GIFs on the page give guides on how to type text prompts to produce results.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>Surprisingly there doesn't seem to be any audio components to this website.</li>
						<li>Text is sometimes animated overtop the videos to add even more flare to the site.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
